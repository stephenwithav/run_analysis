Course Project (Getting and Cleaning Data)
==========================================

This repository contains the script run_analysis.R, which analyzes the
data in the [UCI HAR Dataset](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

The script is to be run from within the UCI_HAR_Dataset directory.
When complete, the script will output the file tidyset.csv.

tidyset.csv contains the averages for each of the `-mean()` and
`-std()` variables, grouped by both subject and activity.  The file
contains 180 rows and 68 columns, including one row for the column
names.
